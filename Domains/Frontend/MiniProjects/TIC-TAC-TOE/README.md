# üïπÔ∏è Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Mini-Project)

**Contributor:** shravanidorle

## Description

This project is a classic, fully functional **Tic-Tac-Toe** game designed for two players. It is built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, demonstrating core front-end logic and DOM manipulation skills.

The game features:

- A clear $3 \times 3$ grid interface.
- Turn-based player logic (Player O vs. Player X).
- Win detection across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- A dedicated display message to announce the winner or a draw.
- **"New Game"** and **"Reset Game"** buttons to restart the game state.

This is an excellent example of a complete, interactive mini-project suitable for the Frontend domain.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **CSS3** (Styling, including custom Google Fonts)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** (Core game logic, turn management, and win checking)
