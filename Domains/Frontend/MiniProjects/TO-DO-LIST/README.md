# To-Do-List App

## Description

This is a clean, classic **To-Do List application** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently:
* Add new tasks using the input field.
* Mark tasks as completed (checked) by clicking on them.
* Delete tasks using the 'x' button that appears next to each item.
* Persists data in the browser's local storage so tasks remain even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

This project is an excellent example of basic DOM manipulation and event handling in pure JavaScript.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  Navigate to this project folder: `Domains/Frontend/MiniProjects/ToDoListApp`
3.  Open the **`index.html`** file directly in any web browser. No local server or dependencies are required.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (Structure)
* CSS3 (Styling, including responsiveness)
* JavaScript (Core application logic and Local Storage management)
