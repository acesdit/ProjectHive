**Contributor:** shravanidorle

## Description

This project is a modern, responsive single-page marketing website for a fictional dog-dating app, **TinDog**. It is built primarily using **HTML5, CSS3, and the Bootstrap 5 framework**.

This mini-project demonstrates proficiency in integrating a comprehensive CSS framework to quickly build a professional-looking layout, including:

* A **Hero Section** with a responsive image and download buttons.
* A **Features Section** using the Bootstrap grid system and custom styling.
* A **Testimonial Section** with company logos.
* A **Pricing Section** featuring responsive cards.
* A standard multi-column **Footer**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Custom styling in `./css/style.css` and `<style>` block)
* **Bootstrap 5.3** (For responsive grid, components, and utility classes)
* **Bootstrap Icons** (For the feature and download icons)

## 🛠️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Ensure the necessary folders (`./css/` for `style.css` and `./images/` for assets like `iphone.png`, `dog-img.jpg`, etc.) are present.
4.  Open the **`index.html`** file directly in any web browser. No local server or dependencies are required.

## 📝 Notes for Future Contributors

* The project uses a custom `gradient-background` class and specific CSS in the `<style>` block for layout adjustments that should be moved to the external `./css/style.css` file for better maintenance.
