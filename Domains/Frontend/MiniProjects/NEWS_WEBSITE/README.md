## How to Run & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Since this project relies on an external API, a one-time setup is required to make the news articles load.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

    (Replace with your actual repository name)

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Get Your API Key:**

    - Sign up for a free account at **[NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/)** to get your personal API key.

4.  **Update `script.js`:**

    - Open the `script.js` file.
    - Replace the placeholder key in the following line with your _own_ key:
      ```javascript
      const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // <--- PASTE YOUR KEY HERE
      ```
    - **Note:** The current key in the provided code is for demonstration only and may not be active. **Using your own key is critical.**

5.  **Run the App:**
    - Open `index.html` in your web browser (e.g., double-click the file).
    - The news feed should now load the latest articles, and you can scroll down to trigger the infinite loading!
